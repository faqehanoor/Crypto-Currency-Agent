# Crypto-Currency-Agent

🚨BREAKING: I just hired a crypto analyst who never sleeps, fetches prices instantly, and doesn’t ask for a raise...

 ✨Meet: CryptoDataAgent 🤖💰

📌Mission Assigned by: Sir Ali Jawwad

 🛠️Built with:
☁️ Gemini 1.5 (yes, the flashy one)
🔗 Chainlit (so it actually talks)
🐍 Python (because coffee wasn’t enough)
💸 Binance API (real data, real fast)

📊 What it does:
 🟢 You: “What’s the price of BTC?”
 🟢 Agent: “Hold my JSON... it's $65,000 😎”
 ✨ Instant, real-time, tool-powered magic.

Why I built it?
 Because I got tired of checking 20 apps just to see how broke I am after every market dip 😂📉
